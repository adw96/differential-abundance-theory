description: "A mathematical framework for understanding (relative and absolute) microbiome differential-abundance methods"

# Abstract

This manuscript develops a mathematical framework for understanding microbiome differential-abundance analysis; 
specifically, how taxonomic bias and other complications of real microbiome measurement can distort the results of commonly-used methods.
This framework predicts that certain approaches to relative and absolute differential abundance are more sensitive to bias than others.
The effects of bias can be mitigated by choosing an insensitive approach or performing a calibration procedure using targeted abundance measurements of one or more specific taxa.
