# A mathematical theory of microbiome differential-abundance methods

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/340487467.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/340487467)

This repository contains an in-progress manuscript on microbiome differential-abundance analysis.
In it, I describe a mathematical framework for determining how taxon-specific bias and other complications of real microbiome measurement can distort the results of commonly-used differential-abundance methods and suggest ways to mitigate these effects.

The manuscript is structured as a [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) article.
