<p>We illustrate the problems posed by taxonomic bias for differential abundance using an example where the bias of an MGS protocol was explicitly measured using mock communities.
To analyze the effects of taxonomic bias on measurements of the human vaginal microbiome, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-brooks2015thet" role="doc-biblioref">Brooks et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-brooks2015thet" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing of mock communities of seven key vaginal species using a similar protocol to that of the Vaginal Human Microbiome Project (VaHMP).
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-mclaren2019cons" role="doc-biblioref">McLaren, Willis, and Callahan</a> (<a href="#ref-mclaren2019cons" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> used this data to estimate the relative measurement efficiency of the seven species.
They found that the most efficiently measured species, <em>Lactobacillus iners</em>, had an efficiency that was 29X that of the least efficiently measured species, <em>Gardnerella vaginalis</em>, primarily due to a greater DNA extraction efficiency and 16S copy number.
A third species, <em>Atopobium vaginae</em>, had an efficiency 1.8X that of <em>G. vaginalis</em>.
A common aim of human vaginal microbiome studies, including the VaHMP, is to understand the causes and consequences of shifts in communities from being dominated by a particular <em>Lactobacillus</em> species to dominance by a non-<em>Lactobacillus</em> species such as <em>G. vaginalis</em>, which have been associated with deleterious health outcomes including an increased risk of preterm births in pregnant women.
It is therefore important to know whether the efficiency variation found by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-mclaren2019cons" role="doc-biblioref">McLaren, Willis, and Callahan</a> (<a href="#ref-mclaren2019cons" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> affects the observed differential abundances between <em>Lactobacillus</em>-dominated and <em>Gardnerella</em>-dominated communities.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="bias-can-cause-spurious-results-in-proportion-based-da-analysis.html#fig:vaginal-example">2.1</a> illustrates the effects of taxonomic bias on the measured proportions for hypothetical vaginal samples from a single woman at two points in time, during which the community shifts from being dominated by <em>Lactobacillus</em> to being dominated by <em>Gardnerella</em>.
In each case, we observe a greater proportion of <em>Lactobacillus</em> than is truly present, and less of the other two species (Figure <a href="bias-can-cause-spurious-results-in-proportion-based-da-analysis.html#fig:vaginal-example">2.1</a>A).
This positive multiplicative error arises because <em>Lactobacillus</em> is more efficiently measured than the average species in each sample.
<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-mclaren2019cons" role="doc-biblioref">McLaren, Willis, and Callahan</a> (<a href="#ref-mclaren2019cons" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span> showed that the observed and actual proportions of a taxon <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in a sample <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> are related by the equation
<span class="math display" id="eq:error">\[\begin{align}
  \tag{2.1}
  \text{observed}_{i}(s) = \text{actual}_{i}(s) \cdot \frac{\text{efficiency}_{i}}{\text{mean efficiency}(s)}
\end{align}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(\text{mean efficiency}(s)=\text{actual}_j(s)*\text{efficiency}_j\)</span> in the denominator is the average efficiency of all taxa in that sample.
Intuitively, Equation <a href="bias-can-cause-spurious-results-in-proportion-based-da-analysis.html#eq:error">(2.1)</a> says that the taxon will be overrepresented by the extent to which its measurement efficiency is greater than the average efficiency of cells in the sample.
Figure <a href="bias-can-cause-spurious-results-in-proportion-based-da-analysis.html#fig:vaginal-example">2.1</a>B shows the efficiencies of the three taxa and the mean efficiency in each sample.
The (multiplicative) difference between the taxon efficiencies and the mean efficiency determines the (multiplicative) error in each sample; for example, the mean efficiency in the second sample is 2.5, leading to a 29/2.5=11.6X error in the proportion of <em>Lactobacillus</em>.
The error in the second sample is largerâspecifically, by 6Xâthan the first sample because the high proportion of <em>Gardnerella</em> has reduced the sample mean efficiency (and thus increased the efficiency of <em>Lactobacillus</em> relative to the mean) by 6X.</p>
<p>The enrichment depends on the taxonâs efficiency relative to the sample average, rather than the efficiency itself, because the requirement that the proportions of all taxa sum to one locks the taxa in a zero-sum competition.
Notably, competition occurs (though in a less absolute form) even at the level of the raw sequencing reads: DNA extractions and PCR reactions have limited output capacity; high-concentration samples are typically subsampled to fixed, lower concentrations; and sequencing libraries are given limited sequencing effort; so that the experimental process itself typically imposes competition to be sequenced.
And it is competition that prevents the effects of taxonomic bias from canceling when we analyze how the proportions of individual taxa change across samples.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="bias-can-cause-spurious-results-in-proportion-based-da-analysis.html#fig:vaginal-example">2.1</a>C shows the consequences of measurement error on an analysis of the fold change in proportions between the two samples.
In reality, <em>Gardnerella</em> changes by 4X, <em>Lactobacillus</em> by 0.1X, and <em>Atopobium</em> by 0.5X.
Yet what is observed is that <em>Gardnerella</em> changes by 32X, <em>Lactobacillus</em> by 0.6X, and <em>Atopobium</em> by 3X.
In other words, the change in each case is multiplied by 6X, causing a much larger increase in <em>Gardnerella</em> and a smaller decrease <em>Lactobacillus</em> than actual, and the appearance that <em>Atopobium</em> increased when it in fact decreased.
Why do such errors occur?
The multiplicative error in Equation <a href="bias-can-cause-spurious-results-in-proportion-based-da-analysis.html#eq:error">(2.1)</a> has two parts: a taxon-specific term in the numerator that is the same in each sample, and a taxon-independent term in the denominator that depends on the composition of the sample through the mean efficiency.
When we compute the fold change in a taxon i between samples s and t,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  \frac{\text{observed}_{i}(t)}{\text{observed}_{i}(s)}=\frac{\text{actual}_{i}(t)}{\text{actual}_{i}(s)}*\frac{\text{efficiency}_{i}}{\text{efficiency}_{i}}*\frac{\text{mean efficiency}(s)}{\text{mean efficiency}(t)}
\end{align}\]</span>
the constant efficiency in the numerator of Equation <a href="bias-can-cause-spurious-results-in-proportion-based-da-analysis.html#eq:error">(2.1)</a> cancels, but the varying mean efficiency does not, leaving an error that is equal to the inverse change in mean efficiency.
As a result, we are here left inferring that the fold-changes in proportions have all increased less (or decreased more) than they truly have.
In our example, the mean efficiency decreased by 6X (from 15 to 2.5) due to the shift in dominant taxon from the high-efficiency <em>Lactobacillus</em> to the low-efficiency <em>Gardnerella</em>, causing the observed fold changes to increase by 6X above the actual.
This increase distorted the magnitudes of the changes in <em>Lactobacillus</em> and <em>Gardnerella</em> (decreasing the first and increasing the second) and changed the sign of <em>Atopobium</em> from negative to positive.
Thus partial cancelling in the effect of a constant multiplicative bias may not be sufficient to protect against spurious results.</p>
<p>Spurious results can occur for the same basic reason in proportion-based absolute-abundance inference.
Suppose that the true total abundance in each sample can be determined experimentally.
Because the absolute abundance estimate simply multiplies the erroneous observed proportions by this total, the estimated change in absolute abundance is wrong by the same factor as the fold change in proportions.
In our Figure <a href="bias-can-cause-spurious-results-in-proportion-based-da-analysis.html#fig:vaginal-example">2.1</a> example, if the change in total abundance between samples were 2X, then we would observed both <em>Lactobacillus</em> and <em>Atopobium</em> to have increased in absolute abundance (by 1.2X and 6X), when in fact <em>Lactobacillus</em> decreased (by 5X) and <em>Atopobium</em> remained the same.</p>
<div id="effect-on-regression-of-multiple-samples" class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Effect on regression of multiple samples</h2>
<p>We showed how fold changes of individual samples may be unreliable.
But microbiome analyses often do not interpret such individual differences, and instead look for average patterns across many samples, such as how the abundance of a taxon varies with some covariate of interest.
The covariate may be discrete, such as whether the sample is from a healthy or sick person, or it may be continuous, such as a measure of space, time, or temperature.
Often these analyses can be framed as a regression problem.
For example, we might hypothesize that the log absolute abundance of taxon <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> changes with a variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> according to the simple linear regression,
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  E[\text{log abundance}_{i} \mid x] = a_{0} + a_{1}x
\end{align}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is either continuous (e.g., sediment depth) or binary (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> for treated patients and <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span> for controls).
Much of the effect of bias will be absorbed by the model intercept, which is typically not of interest to the researcher.
However, variation in the mean efficiency creates additional variation (reducing statistical power to detect variation in the slope) and can also create a statistical bias in our slope estimate equal to the inverse slope of <span class="math inline">\(E[\text{log mean efficiency}\mid x]\)</span> as a function of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.
Therefore if the mean efficiency varies across samples, but is not associated with the covariate <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, its effect may simply be to create larger standard errors in our slope estimate.
But the larger worry may be the systematically distorted slope (<span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span>) estimates that arise in situations where the mean efficiency changes with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.
Notably, the error in an absolute sense is the same for all taxaâthe slope is always reduced by the same amountâbut the implications differ for various taxa depending on their slopes, causing magnitude or sign errors depending how the coefficient derived from the (unknown) true abundances compares to that of the mean efficiency (Figure <a href="bias-can-cause-spurious-results-in-proportion-based-da-analysis.html#fig:regression-example">2.2</a>).</p>
